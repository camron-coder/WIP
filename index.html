		<p>A survey by data analytics company Midia Research shows that 53% of gamers prefer single-player video games compared to live-service titles. Midia Research has not made clear the exact sample size of its study. However, it is known that the company conducted Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 surveys for groups in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Poland, Turkey, and South Africa. Midia has asked a diverse range of people about their gaming habits and attitudes, and a majority of them prefer single-player titles, with examples being The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom and more recent popular releases like the instant-hit Black Myth Wukong.</p><p>Midia's study notes that games like Fortnite and Roblox are exceptions to the rule of the live-service games gold rush. Referring to the situation as "a zero-sum game," it's clear that many companies want to chase the success that those games seem to have set a standard for. Despite this, there are plenty of examples of why that chase is not always worth the trouble. Concord is a notable failure because of how many resources were pumped into the game in contrast to how small of an audience it attracted, but Midia specifically points to titles like Anthem and Babylon's Fall, which some have already forgotten.</p>

		<h1>My responce to the article</h1>
		</header>
		<p>This article talks about how when they took a survey there were still a large amount of gamers that still prefer single player games over multiplayer/live-service games. This both surprised me and didn't at the say time. Over there years we've had lots of great multiplayer titles such a Titanfall 2 , destiny 2, csgo,ect... But we've also had lots of shitty multiplayer titles that fail for various reasons. while yes there have been some great multiplayer titles there track record just isn't as great as single player games so I can really understand the lack of confidence people have for multiplayer titles.</p><p>I think that as the years go on and more people see just how bad the multiplayer space of gaming has gotten,we'll start to see more appreciation for single player titles. We may even start to see compaines invest more into indie studios because there are so many of them that are pushing out great single player titles but are not really getting the same recognition that these AAA games are getting.   </p>
